   <h3 align="center">Raid Block</h3>
  <p align="center">
    A raid timer plugin made for minecraft, similar too rust raid block.
    <br />
How does it work?
Its simple, if tnt explodes in your factions land it will cause you to be raid blocked.
You can change the length of the raid block in the config.

Current Features:
Ability to block commands whilst raid blocked.
Disable gen buckets whilst raid blocked.
Disable the ability to chest / pv spawners raid blocked.
Disable the ability to mine spawners whilst raid blocked.
Disable the ability to break / place blocks in claimed land whilst raid blocked.

I made this plugin in around 4ish hours so please do not judge the code too harshly, I'll be going through and cleaning anything needed up.

(I currently only added support for massivecraft factions, so factions plugins such as FactionsX will not work yet.)
</p>

<b>This plugin is no longer being updated due to there not currently being a way that I know of to track tnt.
